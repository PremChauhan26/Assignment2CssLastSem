            <h2>The Shade - Rex Orange Country</h2>
            <p>
                I was closing all the blinds
                Just so you could sleep the night through
                I was staying by your side
                Just so I knew you were okay
                And I was opening the door
                Just to see if you would walk through
                I started painting all the walls
                Just to see if you liked the shade
            </p>
            <p>
                I would love just to be stuck to your side
                Not with anybody else, anybody else
                It's enough just to keep us occupied
                Please don't go
                I would love just to be stuck to your side
                Not with anybody else, anybody else (Don't go)
                It's enough just to keep us occupied (Please don't go)
            </p>
            <p>
                You were holding out your hands
                Hoping I'd be there to hold to
                I went out to Amsterdam
                Just so I could give you some space
                But I kept opening my door
                Just to see if you would walk through
                But now I'm painting all my walls
                Just to see if you like the shade   
                
            </p>

                I would love just to be stuck to your side
                Not with anybody else, anybody else
                It's enough just to keep us occupied
                Please don't go
                I would love just to be stuck to your side
                Not with anybody else, anybody else (Don't go)
                It's enough just to keep us occupied (Please don't go)

                Not with anybody else, anybody else
                Please don't go
                Not with anybody else, anybody else, no
                Please don't go
